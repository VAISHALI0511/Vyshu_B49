Write a blog on difference between document and window object.

                Document Object:

                           The Document Object is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
                                    eg:Texts,Images,Button's
                           The document object represents the web page. If we want to access any element in an HTML page, we always start with accessing
                                    the document object.
                           Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window.
                           The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model).
                           XML structure is modifiable, we can add values,change and delete because the datas are resident in memory.
                           It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
                           It will return the title of the document.

                Window Object:

                           The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user's browser.
                           The window object methods are used to retrieve the information from the browser window.
                           It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   
                           Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
                           The window is part of BOM (browser object model), not DOM (Document object model).
                           It will return the height of the content area of the browser.
